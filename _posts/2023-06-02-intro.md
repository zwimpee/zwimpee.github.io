## Introduction

This always feels like the hardest part of starting any new project; being able to sit down and write out the first few sentences. 

I have always been put off by the idea of journaling, not because I could not see the value in it, 
but because I have always had a sense that it would take me back and make me relive things that I would have rather
remained dormant somewhere in my subconscious.

Much to my amusement, however, I am finding it quite easy to write this first post. I think it is because I am not
sure what it is I am writing about, other than the fact that I am writing about my long overdue return into the world of deep learning.
