> “Deep learning has solved vision...” - Demis Hassabis (Google DeepMind)

When [Demis Hassabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demis_Hassabis) opened his lecture at the 2015 CERN Data Science conference with this claim, I blinked in disbelief. Hundreds of brilliant scientists have spent their lives pondering the mysteries of the human eye. How could he make that claim so casually? Determined to prove him wrong, I looked at the latest computer vision research and... indeed, certain areas are [at human performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852v1).

The field of deep learning got started when scientists tried to approximate certain circuits in the brain. For example, the Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) – a cornerstone of modern computer vision – was inspired by [a paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4966457) about neurons in the monkey striate cortex. Another example is the field of Reinforcement Learning – the hottest area of AI right now - which was built on our understanding of how the brain processes rewards.
